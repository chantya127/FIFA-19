<h1>Description</h1>
I am big fan of football and machine learning , So why don't combine them both?.The dataset used in this project consist of player attributes like Age, Nationality, Overall, Potential, Club, Value, Wage, Preferred Foot, International Reputation, Weak Foot, Skill Moves, Work Rate, Position, Jersey Number, Joined, Loaned From, Contract Valid Until, Height, Weight, LS, ST, RS, LW, LF, CF, RF, RW, LAM, CAM, RAM, LM, LCM, CM, RCM, RM, LWB, LDM, CDM, RDM, RWB, LB, LCB, CB, RCB, RB, Crossing, Finishing, Heading, Accuracy, ShortPassing, Volleys, Dribbling, Curve, FKAccuracy, LongPassing, BallControl, Acceleration, SprintSpeed, Agility, Reactions, Balance, ShotPower, Jumping, Stamina, Strength, LongShots, Aggression, Interceptions, Positioning, Vision, Penalties, Composure, Marking, StandingTackle, SlidingTackle, GKDiving, GKHandling, GKKicking, GKPositioning, GKReflexes, and Release Clause.

   This  dataset consist of almost 18k football players information ,there are also Indian players in them around 30and that was good to know.That's the power of python and some tools.I have done some analysis such as :-
   
   <ul>
    <li>Which player  fits best for a specific position.</li>
    <li>Build a recommender type of system,which tells players similar to given player</li>
   </ul>

    <ul>
     <li>Used linear regression to predict the overall rating of the player.</li>
     <li> What's the age distribution like? How it is related to overall rating?</li> 
    </ul>
